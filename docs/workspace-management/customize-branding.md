# Customize branding

Openblocks provides a white-labelling feature that allows you to customize your workspace's **branding**, including logo, favicon, brand name and color. You can easily configure branding to match your company's branding and benefit from consistent experiences with your company's existing internal tools.

## Configure branding

Only **workspace admins** have the permission to configure branding. Navigate to [Openblocks homepage](https://cloud.openblocks.dev/), select ⚙️ **Settings** tab **** in **** the left pane and click **Branding**. You can edit the settings on the left and preview the actual effects on the right.

* Logo: click the **Logo** box to upload your logo, which is shown at the top bar. The file browser will pop up and you can select an image file. Openblocks supports `.jpg`, `.svg`, and `.png` files.
* Head color: click the palette in the **Head Color** section to select the background color of the top bar. You can also directly type a CSS color into the box.
* Brand name: enter your **Brand Name** in the input box and it will show on the **login page** and as the browser tab title.
* Favicon: click the **Favicon** box to upload your website icon, which is shown in the browser tab.

Click the **Save** button and the settings will immediately take effect.

The following pictures show what workspace end users will see on the homepage and application pages after branding is successfully customized.
